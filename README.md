1. REASONS FOR THE Abatement of Intereſt, &c.

    _ CHAP. I.

      * Object. 1. That Foreigners will call in their Loans.

      * Object. 2. That the value of the principal Money will be abated, by leſſening the Intereſt; ſo that every
 Man, whoſe whole Eſtate is in Money, will by ſuch a Law, loſe a Third part of it.

      * Object. 3. That ſuch as are indebted, will not be able to take up Money to pay off their Debts, and ſo will be put to great Streights and Difficulties, and many will be undone, and ruin'd.

      * Object. 4. That they who want Money, ſhall not be truſted upon Perſonal Security, which will very much obſtruct, and hinder Trade; for a great part of the Trade of the Nation is carry'd on with Money, borrow'd upon ſuch Security: And Ʋſurers will rather keep their Money by them, than lend upon ſuch Terms.

      * Object. 5. That it is now unſeaſonable, Money being ſcarce.

      * Object. 6. That the Exchequer will draw in all or the greateſt part of the Caſh of the Kingdom.

      * Object. 7. That Widows and Orphans will ſuffer much by an abatement of Intereſt; Thoſe who have Sixty Pound a year for a 1000 l. will then have but Forty.

      * Object. 8. That Gentlemen muſt give more with their Daughters for
 Portions, by which means a great part of the Inheritance of ſuch Gentlemen's Eſtates will be leſſen'd and more incumber'd.

      * Object. 9. Others object, That an Abatement of Intereſt by a Law, is not practicable, nor would it be conducive to the end aim'd at; tho they confeſs a low Intereſt doth moſt encourage Trade, and advance Land.

      * Octject. 10. Many aſſert, That low Intereſt is not the Cauſe, but the effect of Riches; or otherwiſe, ſay they, Why are not all Countries rich, they having it in their Power to make themſelves ſo by a low-ſtated Intereſt by Law.

      * Object. 11. Laſtly, ſome alledge, That all the Reaſons urged for reducing Intereſt to Four in the Hundred, will hold as ſtrongly againſt all Ʋſury.

    _ CHAP. II.
